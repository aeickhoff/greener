# greener
A game for the [TUM semester game jam](https://www.semestergamejam.de/), where the player affects an environment with water, light and wind - fostering growth on one side, bringing death on the other.

The current (probably broken) live version of the game is running at: http://aeickhoff.github.io/greener/

(Should update latest 10 minutes after my last push)
